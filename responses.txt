Semantic elements in html are ways of organizing an html document such that certain elements have specific names and refer to certain types of data. Almost everything could be done using <div> and <span> elements, but these tell someone viewing or editing the html file nothing about the content actually contained on those files. Using semantics such as <header>, <footer>, <article>, or plenty others allows for telling which content is stored in an element at a glance rather than having to carefully analyze the element to figure out what it is. Another key benefit of using semantic elements is that they help mechanisms such as search engines optimize which websites should appear on search queries. In general, using semantic elements has become good style and all html coders should use then whenever possible.
